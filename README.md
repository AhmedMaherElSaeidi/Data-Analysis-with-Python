# Data Analysis with Python Certification Course

I am excited to share that I have completed a comprehensive Data Analysis with Python certification course! ðŸŽ“ðŸ“ˆ Through hands-on projects and real-world datasets, I honed my Python programming skills and applied them to analyze and visualize data effectively.

## Course Highlights

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained insights from data distributions and correlations.
- Model Development: Mastered Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Multivariate Polynomial Regression, and Ridge Regression.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance and refined models for better results.
- Grid Search: Optimized model hyperparameters for improved predictive accuracy.

The course included practical notebooks that covered various topics related to data analysis and prediction. One of the final projects was focused on predicting house prices based on different features. It provided a valuable hands-on experience in applying the learned techniques to a real-world scenario.
